✅ LOGGING COMPILATION ERRORS FULLY RESOLVED (January 7, 2025)
ISSUES FIXED:
1. Missing NullLogger reference - Added 'using Microsoft.Extensions.Logging.Abstractions;' to XamlAnalyzer.cs and SemanticSolutionAnalyzer.cs
2. ILogger vs ILogger<T> type conversion errors - Fixed by creating typed loggers using LoggerFactory.CreateLogger<T>() in Program.cs
3. Static class as type argument error - Changed ILogger<RoslynTools> to Microsoft.Extensions.Logging.ILogger with category string
4. Ambiguous ILogger reference - Fully qualified Microsoft.Extensions.Logging.ILogger to resolve conflict with Serilog.ILogger
5. Async void method issue - Removed await from ClassifyArchitecturalRolesAsync call since method returns void
6. Package version conflicts - Updated Microsoft.Extensions.Logging.Abstractions to version 9.0.4 to match Microsoft.Extensions.Hosting 9.0.4

BUILD STATUS: ✅ Compiles successfully with 0 errors and 0 warnings
ARCHITECTURE: Logging modernization complete with Serilog + Microsoft.Extensions.Logging integration
READY FOR USE: All RoslynMCP tools should now function with proper structured logging
